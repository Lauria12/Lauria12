### 👋 Hi, I’m Lauria Rubega

I’m a Data Science and AI student at Eindhoven University of Technology who enjoys building useful, interesting things with code. From AI game bots to spam filters with NLP, I like working on projects that challenge me and teach me something new.

🧩 **What I’ve worked on:**

* [🌌 Space Mission Simulation](https://github.com/BPasak/SpaceshipSimulation): Modeled planetary motion, designed a lander descent, and planned a probe’s path.
* [🎮 Adaptive AI for Games](https://github.com/SirLeoIV/PlayIT): Created an AI player using Monte Carlo Tree Search and tested neural networks for smarter decisions.
* [📨 Spam Email Detector](https://github.com/horia41/Project2-2-Email-Spam-Classification-with-Sentiment-Analysis): Built a spam classifier with NLP and added a simple GUI for testing results.

🎯 Outside of coding, I stay involved — mentoring new students, helping improve our curriculum, and supporting inclusion at university.

🛠️ **Languages & tools I use:** Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, SQL, Prolog, TensorFlow, PyTorch, R, MATLAB

I'm always open to feedback, learning something new, or teaming up on cool projects — feel free to reach out.
